                    <u>Pitch Analysis</u><br><br>
                    The pitch at the MA Chidambaram stadium is generally a slow wicket with assists the spinners more than the pacers. Over the years, we have seen how the pitch turns more in the second half of an evening game. A total of 76 IPL games have been played at the Cheppauk with 46 matches won by the team batting first and 30 batting second.
                    <br><br>
                    200-plus totals have been posted at this venue but given the conditions, a score of 160-170 can be a winning total. Spinners have enjoyed bowling in this venue with an average of 26.8 and a good economy of 6.9, over the pace bowlers who average 29.4 with an 8.0 economy.

                    <u>Head-to-Head History </u> <br><br>
                    RCB havenâ€™t beaten CSK in Chennai since IPL 2008. Will that streak continue or end on Friday?<br>
                    The last time RCB beat CSK at Chepauk was back in the first IPL season, in 2008.<br>
                    In their most recent fixture there in 2019, RCB was spun out for 70 in 17.1 overs.<br>
